# Gluu Docker Image
**NOTE: This is just a Work-In-Progress snapshot and should be used by caution**

## Preface
Altough Gluu has officialy Docker Edition Workflows it is too complex and requires many requirements.  
This distro simply uses official Ubuntu installion steps and then *Jailbreaks* package container into original container.  
This reduces totoal image size & makes it much easier to maintain and setup...  

# Usage
build latest version (2.4.4.2) And then use template.
